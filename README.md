# SuperHeroes Code Challenge

This project is a RESTful API built with Flask and Flask-SQLAlchemy. It tracks superheroes and their unique superpowers, following a one-to-many relationship. The project is structured to follow best practices in Python and API development.

## Features

- **Superhero Management**: Add, update, and delete superheroes.
- **Power Management**: Add, update, and delete superpowers.
- **HeroPower Assignment**: Assign powers to superheroes with additional attributes such as the hero's rating for a given power.

## Models

1. **Hero**
   - Attributes: `id`, `name`, `super_name`
   - Relationships: A hero can have many powers through the HeroPower model.

2. **Power**
   - Attributes: `id`, `name`, `description`
   - Relationships: Powers can be linked to multiple heroes through the HeroPower model.

3. **HeroPower**
   - Attributes: `id`, `strength` (values: Weak, Average, Strong), `hero_id`, `power_id`
   - Relationships: A join table to connect heroes and powers, with an additional attribute for the power's strength in the hero.
